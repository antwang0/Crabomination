# Feature Roadmap — MTGO / Arena / XMage parity

A prioritized, exhaustive summary of capabilities to add, derived from a
codebase analysis against the three reference clients. This is a
*capabilities* roadmap (engine fidelity + UX + infra); per-card status
lives in `CUBE_FEATURES.md` / `DECK_FEATURES.md` / `STRIXHAVEN2.md` and the
approximations log in `TODO.md`.

Legend: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⏳ not started. Markers reflect a point-in-time
read of the code and should be re-verified before picking up an item.

## Tier 1 — High-leverage engine primitives

Each unblocks a large swath of cards and removes the most visible "that's
not how Magic works" moments.

1. 🟡 **Replacement-effect framework.** A `replacement.rs` framework exists
   but only models zone-change replacements (Commander "→ command zone
   instead", CR 903.9b); the rest is stubbed per-card. Still to generalize:
   ETB replacement (enters tapped / with counters / as a copy / under your
   control; "exile non-cast nontoken creatures instead" ships via
   `StaticEffect::ExileNontokenCreaturesNotCast` — Containment Priest),
   damage *redirection* (Maze of Ith), draw/skip replacement, and
   "if it would die, exile instead." Counter-doubling (Doubling Season,
   Hardened Scales — `StaticEffect::DoubleCounters`) and damage-**doubling**
   (Furnace of Rath — `StaticEffect::DoubleDamageDealt`, applied to both the
   non-combat and combat damage paths, CR 614.2) now ship as multiplier
   replacements. Damage **prevention** is modeled as shields
   (`prevention_shields` + `Effect::PreventNextDamage` /
   `PreventAllDamageThisTurn` / `DamageCantBePreventedThisTurn`, CR
   615.1/615.7/615.12) for the non-combat damage path, plus the existing
   `prevent_combat_damage_this_turn` flag for combat fogs; remaining:
   per-source combat shields, redirection, and damage *halving*.
2. ✅ **Multi-pick / "choose N" decisions.** `Decision::ChooseModes` is
   wired (`game/effects/mod.rs`, `DecisionAnswer::Modes`). "Pick from
   revealed cards" is also wired: `Effect::LookPickToHand` (Impulse /
   Strategic Planning / Flow State) presents the peeked top-of-library set
   through the `SearchLibrary` decision; auto-decider keeps the top card.
3. ✅ **Player-chosen combat damage assignment order.**
   `Decision::CombatDamageOrder { attacker, blockers }` prompts the attacker
   (`combat.rs`, CR 510.1c) instead of sorting by CardId. (Trample-over-
   lethal / deathtouch spread math rides on top — see Tier 6.)
4. ✅ **Linked "until this leaves play" exile** (CR 603.6e).
   `Effect::ExileUntilSourceLeaves` (target a permanent) and
   `Effect::ExileChosenUntilSourceLeaves` (pick from a hand) stamp
   `CardInstance.exiled_by`; `return_linked_exiles` (called from every
   battlefield-removal path) returns the card to battlefield or hand when
   the source leaves. Wired Banisher Priest, Fiend Hunter, Oblivion Ring,
   Brain Maggot, Tidehollow Sculler.
5. 🟡 **Copy of a permanent (clone).** `Effect::BecomeCopyOf` (CR 707.2,
   one-shot definition rewrite) + the `CardDefinition.enters_as_copy` ETB
   hook (applied before SBA so a 0/0 copier never dies first) ship Clone
   and Phantasmal Image (Illusion + sacrifice-when-targeted rider), Mirror
   Image, Stunt Double. Copied ETB triggers re-fire (CR 707.5). Token
   copies ride `CreateTokenCopyOf` (Cackling Counterpart). Remaining:
   "becomes a copy" *continuous* layer-1 effects (Helm of the Host's
   haste-token loop, Mirrorform aura) and copied enters-with-counters.
6. 🟡 **Copy-a-spell-on-the-stack.** `Effect::CopySpell` /
   `CopySpellUnlessPaid` exist and ship Storm / sac-to-copy cards, but the
   copy keeps the original's targets. Remaining: **new-target choice** on
   the copy — Twinning, Fork.

## Tier 2 — Engine rules fidelity (beyond Tier 1)

- 🟡 **APNAP trigger ordering** — inter-player APNAP (`game/mod.rs`
  apnap_rank sort, CR 603.3b) plus same-controller ordering: a `wants_ui`
  controller orders their own simultaneous triggers via
  `Decision::OrderTriggers` (`order_same_controller_triggers`, consulted
  synchronously); AutoDecider keeps the default order. The client modal is
  wired (`spawn_order_triggers_modal` + `handle_trigger_reorder`).
  Remaining: a server-side *suspend* path so a networked human is actually
  prompted (today the dispatch consults the decider inline, so a remote
  seat degrades to the default order). Tracked in TODO.md.
- 🟡 **Divided damage** across N targets — `Effect::DealDamageDivided` +
  `Decision::DivideDamage` ship Forked Bolt, Pyrokinesis, Crackle with Power,
  Magma Opus (AutoDecider spreads evenly; UI/scripted deciders choose the
  split). Remaining: divided *non-damage* riders ("tap up to N", split-mill)
  and true "choose targets as it resolves".
- ⏳ **Targeting refinements:** "up to N targets", "target each", "another
  target", same-target-twice rules, protection re-check on resolution.
- ⏳ **Continuous-effect breadth:** characteristic-defining abilities,
  type/color/text-changing effects (CR 613 layers 1–6 corner cases),
  "becomes a copy of" layer interaction, set-P/T vs +N/+N ordering.
- 🟡 **Static ability framework:** cost-reduction statics, "you may play"
  permissions from permanents, "creatures you control have X", anthem
  stacking — wired. Devotion-gated creature states (Nyx gods) ship via
  `StaticEffect::NotCreatureWhileDevotionBelow` (CR 700.5). Remaining:
  broader "you may play" permissions and devotion-gated *non-type* states.
- 🟡 **Replacement of life/draw/damage events** (ties to Tier-1 #1).
- ⏳ **Regeneration shields & "the next time" prevention** as proper shields
  rather than instantaneous.
- ⏳ **Damage marking vs. wither/-1/-1**, lethal/indestructible interplay
  audited against CR 120 / 704.
- ⏳ **Loyalty fidelity:** activate at sorcery speed once/turn (have), but
  also loyalty-set effects, "can be activated any time" riders, proliferate
  on loyalty, attacking planeswalkers redirect rules.
- ⏳ **State-based action coverage audit:** legend rule for planeswalkers
  (post-2017 unified rule), world rule, +1/-1 counter annihilation,
  saga-chapter sacrifice, attached-Aura falls off, token ceases to exist.

## Tier 3 — Object model & zones

- ⏳ **Battle card type** (CR 110.4) + defense counters +
  `AttackTarget::Battle` (noted in `TODO.md`).
- ⏳ **Sagas** (lore counters, chapter abilities, DFC sagas).
- ⏳ **Split cards** (CR 709) + **Fuse**.
- ⏳ **Adventure** (cast-the-spell-then-exile-to-cast-creature duality).
- ⏳ **Classes / Rooms / Cases / Backgrounds** (enchantment subtypes with
  level/door mechanics).
- ⏳ **Leveler cards** (level-up counters).
- ⏳ **Flip cards** (Kamigawa), **Meld** (Mightstone/Weakstone et al.),
  **Prototype**, **Omen**.
- ⏳ **Face-down permanents** generalized (Morph exists as a keyword; needs
  the 2/2-face-down object, manifest, disguise/cloak, cloak).
- ⏳ **Ante / conspiracy / dungeon (venture) / sticker / attraction** zones
  (low priority; only for novelty formats).
- ✅ **Emblems** as command-zone objects (planeswalker ultimates) —
  `Player.emblems` + `Effect::CreateEmblem`; triggers dispatch event-keyed
  (`emblem_event_matches`) and step-keyed (`fire_step_triggers`); surfaced in
  `PlayerView.emblems`. Wired Dellian Fel -6, Dakkon -6, Saheeli Rai -7.
- ⏳ **Sideboard zone** + "from outside the game" (wishes, companions).

## Tier 4 — Keyword & ability mechanics (the long tail)

Grouped roughly by how many cards each unlocks. Each is a small, targeted
feature; sweep card-batch by card-batch.

- **High frequency / modern staples:** ✅ Madness (`Keyword::Madness`,
  discard→exile→offer-cast in `discard_card`/`offer_madness_cast`, CR
  702.35), ✅ Escape (`Keyword::Escape(cost, n)` + `GameAction::CastEscape`,

- **Cast-from-elsewhere:** ⏳ cast-from-top (Mind's Desire / Amped Raptor /
  Robber of the Rich), ⏳ Suspend (+ time counters), ⏳ Forecast,
  ⏳ Hideaway, ⏳ Aftermath.
- **Combat-flavor:** ✅ Bushido / ✅ Flanking / ✅ Rampage
  (`Keyword::{Bushido,Flanking,Rampage}` — combat-step rules in
  `declare_blockers`),
  ✅ Provoke (`shortcut::provoke` — CR 702.39, on-attack untap + force-block
  via `Effect::Provoke` + `CardInstance.must_block`),

  ⏳ Enlist, ⏳ Mobilize, ⏳ Myriad.
- **Value/ETB:** ✅ Investigate (`shortcut::investigate(n)` — CR 701.13,
  mints `clue_token()`s; Thraben Inspector. Sac-Clue payoff rides the

  `MayPay({W/B}, drain 1)`; Basilica Screecher, Syndic of Tithes, Tithe
  Drinker, Kingpin's Pet), ⏳ Cohort, ⏳ Support.
- **Spell-matters:** ⏳ Splice, ⏳ Replicate, ⏳ Overload, ⏳ Cipher,
  ⏳ Surge, ⏳ Spectacle, ⏳ Addendum, ⏳ Conspire, ⏳ Demonstrate.
- **Resource systems:** ✅ Energy ({E}) — `Player.energy` pool +
  `Effect::AddEnergy` / `Effect::PayEnergy`; surfaced in `PlayerView.energy`
  + HUD chip; bot spends surplus via `pick_energy_payoff`. Wired the
  Kaladesh set (`sets::kld`: Longtusk Cub, Bristling Hydra, Dynavolt Tower,
  Aether Swooper, Glimmer of Genius, …). ⏳ remaining: energy-gated *mana*
  abilities (Aether Hub / Servant collapse the {E}-mana split). ⏳ Experience
  counters,
  ✅ Poison/Toxic (`Keyword::Toxic(N)` adds N poison on combat damage,
  CR 702.180c; 10-poison loss SBA wired),
  ✅ Devotion (CR 700.5 — `Value::DevotionTo`,
  `StaticEffect::NotCreatureWhileDevotionBelow` god gate,
  `ManaPayload::DevotionOfChosenColor`; surfaced in `PlayerView.devotion`
  + HUD chip), ⏳ Ascend / city's blessing,

- **Fading family:** ⏳ Fading, ⏳ Vanishing (Parallax cards in cube).

  ⏳ Affinity (have artifact count?), ⏳ Entwine, ⏳ Buyback, ⏳ Miracle,
  ⏳ Bloodrush, ⏳ Unleash, ⏳ Scavenge, ⏳ Bestow, ⏳ Tribute.

## Tier 5 — Mana & cost system

- ⏳ **Mana provenance tag** — fixes Fellwar Stone, Locus scaling
  (Cloudpost/Glimmerpost), Cavern type-gated uncounterability in one shot.
- ⏳ **Per-source mana restrictions** ("spend only on X", filter lands).
- ⏳ **Minimum-cost floor** (Trinisphere) and **cost-increase statics**
  beyond the existing first-spell tax (Thalia, Sphere of Resistance).
- ⏳ **Conditional / additional costs** as a general modal layer (sacrifice,
  discard, pay life, exile-from-gy as alt/escape costs, tap creatures).
- ⏳ **{X} in activated abilities** generalized; **delve/convoke colored**
  contribution (currently generic-only).
- ⏳ **Snow-mana-only** and **mana-value-X** cost gates.

## Tier 6 — Combat fidelity

- ⏳ **Damage assignment order** (Tier-1 #3) and **trample math** with
  multiple/deathtouch blockers.
- ⏳ **Banding** combat rules (keyword exists; rules not wired).
- ⏳ **Multiple combat phases / extra attack steps** (Aggravated Assault).
- 🟡 **"Must attack/block", "can't attack alone", "attacks each combat"**
  restrictions and requirements. `Keyword::CantAttack` / `CantBlock`
  (Pacifism), `Keyword::AttacksAlone` (CR 508.0 — Master of Cruelties),
  `Keyword::MustBeBlocked` (CR 509.1c — "must be blocked", Academic
  Dispute), `Keyword::AllMustBlock` (CR 509.1c true Lure — every able
  creature must block; Lure aura), and `Keyword::MustAttack`
  (CR 508.1d — "attacks each combat if able", Juggernaut) are wired from
  computed keywords in `declare_attackers`/`declare_blockers`. **Goad**
  (CR 701.38) is wired via `CardInstance.goaded_by` + `Effect::Goad`
  (treated as must-attack, clears at the goader's next untap — Disrupt
  Decorum). Still open: *granted* must-attack with a future-turn-scoped
  duration ("attacks next turn if able" — Big Play mode 0); the
  goaded "attack a player other than the goader" clause in multiplayer;
  must-block requirements on the blocker side; cost-to-block (509.1d-f).
- ⏳ **Planeswalker / Battle as attack targets** UI + redirection.
- ✅ **Goad** (above). ✅ **Lure** (`Keyword::AllMustBlock`).
  ✅ **Provoke** (`shortcut::provoke`, CR 702.39).
  ⏳ **Ninjutsu attacking-creature swap**.

## Tier 7 — UI / UX core (the Arena "feel" gap)

Mostly buildable on existing `ClientView` / `StackItemView` data.

1. ⏳ **Big card-zoom preview on hover** — table-stakes; only a counter
   tooltip exists today.
2. ⏳ **Stops / auto-yield configuration** — per-phase stops + "yield until
   something needs me" (priority plumbing already exists; today only Pass /
   End Turn / Next Turn).
3. ⏳ **Combat math / damage preview** — projected life swing + which
   creatures die on declared attacks/blocks.
4. ⏳ **Undo / mana-tap rollback** — undo un-committed taps before a spell
   locks in (`ManualTapRequired` already signals partial manual-tap model).
5. 🟡 **Targeting arrows on the stack** — `KnownStackItem` now carries
   `additional_targets` (all slots, not just slot 0), so the client can draw
   an arrow to every target of a multi-target spell. Arrow rendering itself
   still ⏳.
6. ⏳ **Hold-priority toggle** ("F" key auto-pass; shift-hold to keep
   priority after your spell resolves).
7. ⏳ **Stack visualization** with response affordances and "respond / let
   resolve" per item.
8. ⏳ **Phase bar / step indicator** with click-to-advance and stop markers.

## Tier 8 — UI / UX quality-of-life

- ⏳ Browsable **graveyard / exile / library-count** zoom per player.
- ⏳ **Search / Scry / Surveil / Mulligan** dedicated picker UIs (drag,
  reorder, bottom).
- ⏳ Confirm **London mulligan** bottoming + scry-on-keep.
- ⏳ **Floating life deltas** + per-turn life-history graph.
- ⏳ **Hand sorting / auto-tap preferences / "play tapped land" prompt**.
- ⏳ **Reminder text & rules tooltips** on keywords; **oracle text panel**.
- ⏳ **Hotkey legend / help overlay**; remappable keys.
- 🟡 **Highlight legal plays** (castable cards, legal attackers/blockers,
  legal targets) — `ClientView` now carries `castable_hand`,
  `pitchable_hand`, `kickable_hand`, and **`activatable_permanents`** (each
  dry-run through `would_accept`). Remaining: legal-attacker/blocker and
  per-target hint layers (`legal_target_filter` exists to build on).
- ⏳ **Animations & SFX** polish; **board-state pings / alerts**
  (low life, triggers waiting, your turn).
- ⏳ **Settings menu** (graphics quality exists; add audio, gameplay,
  accessibility tabs).
- ⏳ **Battlefield organization** (auto-tuck lands, group tokens, stack
  identical permanents).

## Tier 9 — Multiplayer & social

- ⏳ **Lobby / matchmaking** (host, join-by-code, quick-match).
- ⏳ **Reconnect / resume** a dropped game (snapshots make this feasible).
- ⏳ **Spectator mode** (read-only `ClientView` stream).
- ⏳ **Chat + emotes** (Arena's canned phrases; XMage free chat).
- ⏳ **Per-turn / per-game timers, chess-clock, "rope," and timeouts.**
- ⏳ **Friends / invites / ratings / leaderboards** (server-side).
- ⏳ **Free-for-all politics** UI (deals, voting, monarch/initiative
  passing) for 3+ player tables.

## Tier 10 — Formats & match structure

- ⏳ **Best-of-3 + sideboarding** flow (core competitive structure).
- ⏳ **Deck legality validation** per format (banlist, size, singleton,
  color identity for Commander).
- ⏳ **More 60-card formats:** Modern, Pioneer, Legacy, Vintage, Pauper
  (mostly banlist/pool config on top of existing rules).
- ⏳ **Limited match rules** (40-card, basic-land access).
- ⏳ **Multiplayer variants:** Planechase (planar deck + dice),
  Archenemy (scheme deck), Commander variants (Oathbreaker, Brawl exists),
  Star, Emperor.
- ⏳ **Casual toggles:** free mulligans, starting-hand rules, vanguard.

## Tier 11 — Limited (draft / sealed)

- ✅/🟡 **Draft + cube** exist. Extend with:
- ⏳ **Sealed** (open packs, build pool).
- ⏳ **Bot drafters** with signal/pick heuristics (beyond random).
- ⏳ **Draft variants:** Winston, Rochester, Grid, Solomon, Glimpse, Team.
- ⏳ **Set-based draft** (pack composition by rarity/collation).
- ⏳ **Draft replay / pick history / pool export.**

## Tier 12 — Deckbuilding & collection

- ⏳ **In-app deck builder** (search by name/type/cost/keyword, curve view,
  legality check, sample-hand tester).
- ⏳ **Import / export** (Arena/MTGO/.dec/.cod text formats).
- ⏳ **Deck stats** (mana curve, color pips, type breakdown).
- ⏳ **Collection / ownership tracking** (if a progression layer is wanted).
- ⏳ **Card search engine** over the catalog (Scryfall-like syntax).

## Tier 13 — AI

- 🟡 **Smarter blocking** — the bot blocks "at random" (`server/bot.rs`);
  add survive-don't-chump, gang-block lethal, deathtouch/trample awareness.
  Highest-value single-player improvement.
- ⏳ **Better sequencing** (land drops, hold-up interaction, when to cast).
- 🟡 **Mulligan decisions** — `RandomBot` ships flooded/screwed opening
  hands via `decide_mulligan`: keep 2–5 lands **and** at least one nonland
  spell castable early (mana value ≤ lands + 1, with **color-screw
  awareness** — the lands must produce the spell's colored pips), stop after
  two mulligans. Remaining: transitive fetch/dual color sources (a lone
  fetchland still reads as colorless).
- ⏳ **Targeting / mode / X-value choices** by evaluation, not first-legal.
- ⏳ **Difficulty levels**; optional **search-based AI** (MCTS over the
  deterministic engine + snapshot cloning).

## Tier 14 — Replays, analysis & observability

- ⏳ **Action-log replay viewer** (step forward/back; snapshots + the
  `GameEvent` stream are the foundation).
- ⏳ **Game history / match results** persistence.
- ⏳ **Export game to shareable file**; import to reproduce bugs (the audit
  workflow already uses snapshots — formalize it).
- ⏳ **In-game "what happened" event filtering** in the log (by player,
  zone, type).

## Tier 15 — Accessibility

- ⏳ **Colorblind-safe** mana/color indicators (not color alone).
- ⏳ **Text scaling / high-contrast / reduced-motion** options.
- ⏳ **Full keyboard play** (cursor exists; complete the coverage).
- ⏳ **Screen-reader / narration** of board state and prompts.
- ⏳ **"Full control" mode** (XMage) — never auto-skip priority/steps.

## Tier 16 — Infra, correctness & content tooling

- ⏳ **Seeded / deterministic RNG** surfaced for reproducible games & tests.
- ⏳ **Snapshot round-trip property tests** + **fuzzing** of action
  sequences against SBA invariants.
- ⏳ **Crash-recovery / autosave** from snapshots.
- ⏳ **Card-scripting DSL or macro layer** to reduce catalog boilerplate
  (the catalog is large and hand-written).
- ⏳ **Set / Scryfall import pipeline** + automated data verification
  (`scripts/verify_cards.py` exists — extend it).
- ⏳ **Card art / image pipeline** for the client.
- ⏳ **Rules-engine conformance suite** mapped to CR section numbers.

---

## Suggested sequencing

1. **Replacement-effect framework** (Tier-1 #1) — the highest-leverage
   primitive still open. (Combat damage-order and multi-pick "choose N"
   decisions, formerly bundled here, are now wired.)
2. **Card-zoom preview + stops/auto-yield + combat-math preview**
   (Tier-7 #1–3) — the trio that most closes the "feels like Arena" gap.
3. **Best-of-3 + sideboard + deck legality** (Tier 10) — makes draft/cube
   and constructed competitive.
4. **Static-ability framework + mana provenance** — broad correctness wins
   that unblock many cards at once. (Inter-player APNAP ordering is already
   wired; only same-controller trigger ordering remains.)
5. **Smarter AI blocking** (Tier 13) — biggest single-player upgrade.
6. Then the **Tier-4 mechanic sweep** and **Tier-3 object-model** features,
   card batch by card batch, promoting entries in the per-card trackers.
7. **Replays, spectator, social, accessibility** as the product matures.
