# Deck Implementation Tracker

Tracking two fully-playable decks:
- **BRG combo** (Cosmogoyf + Thud, Pact-style)
- **Goryo's Vengeance reanimator**

Both ship as the default demo match
(`crabomination::demo::build_demo_state` — P0 = BRG, P1 = Goryo's).

Done (✅) cards and engine features are elided; only remaining 🟡/⏳ work is
listed. Full per-card history is in git.

## Legend

- 🟡 partial — card exists, key behavior missing
- ⏳ todo — not yet implemented

### BRG main deck / sideboard

All ✅ and elided.

## Modern supplement (`catalog::sets::decks::modern`)

Extra Modern- and cube-playable cards. Most ride existing engine primitives;
newer batches also added small reusable ones (no-max-hand-size,
play-lands-from-graveyard, mana-doubling, ability-lock statics, Cipher, block
tax, landfall, graveyard escape/retrace, level bands, sideboard wishes,
manifest-from-hand, token Role Auras, Absorb, Cleave, reflect-prevention
shields, restricted colorless mana, multi-pick reveals, …). Each card has at
least one test in `crabomination/src/tests/modern.rs`.

All Modern-supplement cards are ✅ and elided (including Karn, Scion of Urza
and Tezzeret, Cruel Captain, now wired to real oracle text).

## Engine features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Uncounterable spell flag | ✅ | `StackItem::Spell.uncounterable`, respected by `CounterSpell`. Cavern of Souls stamps casts uncounterable via mana provenance; Veil of Summer is a turn-scoped grant. |
| X-cost creature side-effects | 🟡 | Thud / Burn at the Stake ride `SacrificeAndRemember` + `Value::SacrificedPower`. Casualty and Adventure ✅. |
| Sacrifice-as-cost effects | 🟡 | Thud ✅; variable-count sacrifice ✅ (`Effect::SacrificeAnyNumber`); flashback-with-additional-cost ✅ (Lava Dart, Dread Return). |

## Plan

Work top-down; each phase unlocks more behavior:

1. **Catalog stubs** — correct cost/types/P-T/keywords, effects = `Noop` where
   unsupported. Both decks playable as bodies.
2. **Wire `demo.rs`** for the singleplayer match (P0 = BRG, P1 = Goryo's).
3. **Tractable engine features** unlocking multiple cards: alternative pitch
   costs, shock/surveil/fastland ETB choices, Convoke/Converge.
4. **Card-specific features:** Pact upkeep costs, Rebound, Goryo's exile-at-EOT,
   Atraxa reveal-and-sort, static effects, counter-an-ability.
5. **Opening-hand effects** (Chancellor, Leyline, Gemstone Caverns, Serum
   Powder) — need pre-game mulligan-window machinery.

When promoting a card, flip its dependent engine-feature row too.
