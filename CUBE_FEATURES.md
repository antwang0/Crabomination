# Cube Implementation Tracker

Tracking the work to make this Modern-style cube fully playable. The cube
is built around a mix of efficient creatures, interaction, value engines,
and combo lines — see the maybeboard at the end of this file.

The catalog already implements the cards used by the BRG / Goryo's demo
decks (`DECK_FEATURES.md` is the source of truth there); some of those
cards overlap with the cube. Most of the cube is still ⏳. **Done (✅)
cards and engine features have been elided** — only the remaining 🟡/⏳
work is listed below.

## Legend

- 🟡 partial — exists with a simplified or stub effect; key behavior missing
- ⏳ todo — not yet implemented

### White

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tempt with Bunnies | ⏳ | Tempting offer (chain-creating) — needs multi-player choice primitive. |

### Blue

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gather Specimens | ⏳ | Replace creature ETB control-shift. Replacement effect primitive. |
| Mirrorform | ⏳ | Aura + clone target. |
| The Everflowing Well | ⏳ | Saga land flip; needs Saga lore counters + DFC. |
| Shelldock Isle | ⏳ | Hideaway land (DFC-like setup). |
| Sink into Stupor | ⏳ | Counter + DFC into Lair land. |
| Concealing Curtains | ⏳ | DFC into Revealing Eye creature. |

### Black

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mutated Cultist | ⏳ | Mutate primitive needed. |
| Necrotic Ooze | ⏳ | Gains all activated abilities of creatures in graveyards. Big ability-borrow primitive. |
| Unholy Annex // Ritual Chamber | ⏳ | DFC enchantment land. |

### Red

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Amped Raptor | 🟡 | 2/1 Dinosaur; ETB now grants real energy ({E}{E}) via `Effect::AddEnergy` (energy system shipped in `sets::kld`). The exile-then-pay-energy-to-cast-free clause is still omitted (no energy-gated free-cast-from-exile path). |

### Green

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hauntwoods Shrieker | ⏳ | Token + transform. |
| Aluren | ⏳ | Free-cast 3 or less creatures. |
| Shifting Woodland | ⏳ | DFC land. |

### Artifacts & Planeswalkers (mono / colorless)

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Agatha's Soul Cauldron | ⏳ | Borrow activated abilities of exiled creatures. |
| The Mightstone and Weakstone | 🟡 | {5} Artifact; ETB `ChooseMode` (Draw 2 / target creature -5/-5 EOT); `{T}`: Add {C}{C}. Meld/assemble omitted. |

### Multicolor

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver | 🟡 | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 102): {1}{U}{B} 3-loyalty Planeswalker. **+2**: target opponent mills 3 (the "exiled with Ashiok" linkage is engine-wide ⏳ — milled cards land in opp graveyard). **-1**: Exile target opp creature (the "create a copy" half collapses). **-10**: Approximated as `WinGame { You }` (the "each opp draws 7 from exile" plinker ultimate is dropped). Tests: `ashiok_nightmare_weaver_plus_two_mills_opponent_three`, `ashiok_nightmare_weaver_minus_one_exiles_creature`. |
| Sorin, Grim Nemesis | 🟡 | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 102): {4}{B}{B} 6-loyalty Planeswalker. **+1**: Draw 1 + Lose 3 life (approximation; reveal/MV-life-loss/conditional-token chain dropped). **-X**: ping (the X-cost loyalty path uses `Value::XFromCost` against creature/PW + 1 gain life). **-9**: drain 10 from each opponent (the printed "X = cards in opp's graveyard" scaling collapses). Tests: `sorin_grim_nemesis_plus_one_draws_and_loses_three_life`, `sorin_grim_nemesis_minus_nine_drains_each_opponent`. |
| Saheeli Rai | 🟡 | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 102): {1}{U}{R} 3-loyalty Planeswalker. **+1**: Scry 1 + ping each opponent for 1 (the "and each PW they control" half drops — no `EachOpponentsPlaneswalker` selector). **-2**: Create a token copy of target friendly creature/artifact, grant haste, delay-trigger Exile at next end step. **-7**: Same body fired twice (the emblem-recurring "each end step" auto-recur is approximated). Tests: `saheeli_rai_plus_one_pings_each_opponent`, `saheeli_rai_minus_two_creates_haste_copy`. |
| The Gitrog Monster | ⏳ | Land-as-discard / dredge engine. |
| Wear // Tear | 🟡 | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 102): {1}{R} Sorcery, single-spell approximation that destroys target artifact OR enchantment. The Split-Card primitive (CR 709) is engine-wide ⏳ — both halves collapse to a single faithful effect at the Wear cost. Fuse mode is dropped. Test: `wear_tear_destroys_target_artifact`. |
| Zirda, the Dawnwaker | ⏳ | Companion + activated-cost reduction. Needs Companion primitive. |
| Lonis, Genetics Expert | 🟡 (was ⏳) | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 103): {1}{G}{U} Legendary 2/2 Otter Detective. ETB trigger on other creatures you control creates a Clue token (the printed "investigate" rider via `clue_token()`). The "Sacrifice X Clues: target opp reveals top X cards" activated ability is engine-wide ⏳ (no per-activation X-cost prompt yet). Test: `lonis_genetics_expert_creates_clue_when_other_creature_enters`. |
| Tamiyo, Collector of Tales | 🟡 | Push (claude/modern_decks batch 102): {2}{G}{U} 4-loyalty Planeswalker. **-2**: Return target card from gy → hand. **-3**: Search library → hand (the "same name as a card in target opponent's graveyard" filter is engine-wide ⏳ — falls back to `Any`). **-7**: Draw 4 (the "distinct nonland types in gy" scaling drops). The static "spells your opps control can't make you discard or sac" is engine-wide ⏳. Test: `tamiyo_collector_minus_two_returns_card_from_graveyard`. |
| Dakkon, Shadow Slayer | 🟡 | WUB Legendary Planeswalker. +1: Surveil 2. -3: Exile target creature. -6: emblem (`Effect::CreateEmblem`, approximated as "draw a card at your upkeep"). Body fully wired; only the emblem's exact text is an approximation. |
| Rediscover the Way | ⏳ | TBD. |
| Shiko and Narset, Unified | ⏳ | TBD. |
| Teval, Arbiter of Virtue | 🟡 | {2}{B}{G}{U} 6/6 Spirit Dragon, flying + lifelink + "lose life equal to each cast spell's mana value". The "spells you cast have delve" static grant is engine-wide ⏳ and dropped. Test: `teval_loses_life_equal_to_cast_spell_mana_value`. |
| Muldrotha, the Gravetide | ⏳ | Cast from graveyard each turn (one of each card type). |
| Rakshasa's Bargain | 🟡 | Pay 4 life + Draw 4. The "exile creature card from your graveyard" alternate additional cost is folded away (modal additional-cost not modeled). |
| Omnath, Locus of Creation | ⏳ | Landfall-quad-color. |
| Leyline of the Guildpact | 🟡 | {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} Enchantment; "lands you control are every basic land type" via new `StaticEffect::GrantAllBasicLandTypes` (layer-4 `SetLandTypes` → intrinsic any-color mana). The "your permanents are all colors" half and the opening-hand Leyline rider are dropped. Test: `leyline_of_the_guildpact_makes_your_lands_all_basic_types`. |

### Lands

| Card | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Power Depot | 🟡 | Artifact Land, enters tapped, `{T}: Add {C}` + `{T}: Add one mana of any color`. The "spend only on artifact spells/abilities" mana restriction and Modular 1 are dropped. Test: `power_depot_enters_tapped_and_fixes_mana`. |
| Talon Gates of Madara | ⏳ | TBD. |

## Engine features needed

The cube draws on a much wider mechanic set than the BRG / Goryo's pair.
This list is the work needed to bring most of the cube online; the engine
features already implemented (Pact / Flashback / Convoke / Rebound / etc.)
are listed in `DECK_FEATURES.md`.

| Feature | Status | Cards depending on it |
|---|---|---|
| Equipment + equip-cost activated ability | 🟡 | `GameAction::Equip` + `equipped_bonus` ship Shuko, Lavaspur Boots (✅). Board-scaled equip bonus ships via `EquipBonus.scale` — Nettlecyst ✅. Equipment-granted triggered abilities ship via `EquipBonus.triggered_abilities` (CR 702.6e; `DealsCombatDamageToPlayer` SelfSource fires off the equipped creature, damaged player bound to `Target(0)`) — Sword of Body and Mind ✅. Lion Sash ✅ (counter-on-self scaled bonus + Reconfigure CR 702.151 — `Keyword::Reconfigure` reuses the equip path and strips Creature-ness while attached). Living weapon ✅ (Nettlecyst, Batterskull — ETB mint-a-Germ-and-attach). Remaining: Reconfigure *unattach* mode. |
| Adventure (cost-mode duality) | ✅ | CR 715 — `CardDefinition.adventure` + `GameAction::CastAdventure`/`CastAdventureCreature`. Virtue of Loyalty (enchantment // instant) ships on it alongside the creature adventures. |
| Mutate | ⏳ | Mutated Cultist, Mutable Explorer. |
| Storm count + cast-from-top | 🟡 | Storm count is wired (`Value::StormCount`, `Keyword::Storm` auto-copies on cast, per-turn `spells_cast_this_turn`) and `Effect::CopySpell` exists. Exile-top-and-grant-free-play (`Effect::ExileTopAndGrantMayPlay`) ships Robber of the Rich and Mind's Desire (Storm × exile-top + may-play-free). Energy-gated free cast-from-exile (Amped Raptor) is still ⏳. |
| Ninjitsu | ⏳ | Fallen Shinobi (any future ninjas). |
| Soulbond | ✅ | `Keyword::Soulbond` + `CardInstance.soulbond_partner` + `CardDefinition.soulbond_bonus` (`SoulbondBonus`: P/T, keywords, granted activated **and** triggered abilities). Pairs auto-resolve on ETB (`apply_soulbond_pairing`); the bonus rides both members as continuous effects and breaks on leave. Wolfir Silverheart, Wingcrafter, Nightshade Peddler, Trusted Forcemage, Hanweir Lancer, Silverblade Paladin, Nearheath Pilgrim, Deadeye Navigator (self-flicker), Tandem Lookout (combat-damage draw). |
| Companion (deck-construction restriction + start-side mana cost) | ⏳ | Zirda, the Dawnwaker. |
| Saga lore counters + DFC | ⏳ | The Everflowing Well; future sagas. |
| Hideaway lands | ⏳ | Shelldock Isle. |
| Verge / surveil land family expansion | 🟡 | All five enemy/allied `*verge` lands (Blazemire/Thornspire/Bleachbone/Riverpyre/Wastewood) ship via `verge_land` (conditional second-color mana ability). Horizon-canopy cycle is complete (`horizon_land` helper; all six). Surveil-land expansion still ⏳. |
| ETB-replacement effects (suppress entirely) | 🟡 | "Exile non-cast nontoken creature instead" wired (`StaticEffect::ExileNontokenCreaturesNotCast`, Containment Priest ✅). Remaining: Gather Specimens (steal-instead), Hushbringer-style trigger suppression. |
| Spell-tax statics ("costs {1} more", "costs at least {3}") | 🟡 | Damping Sphere wired (`AdditionalCostAfterFirstSpell`); Trinisphere needs a "minimum cost" flavor. Elite Spellbinder reuses the existing tax static. |
| "Cast spells without paying mana" static | ⏳ | Omniscience, Maelstrom Archangel (combat-damage variant), Aluren (free-cast under-3 creatures). |
| Name-a-card primitive | 🟡 | `Effect::NameCard` + `Decision::NameCard` + `CardInstance.named_card` ship Pithing Needle / Phyrexian Revoker (ETB stamps a name; `activate_ability` suppresses non-mana abilities of matching sources). Same-name exile (Crumble to Dust) is wired via `Effect::ExileSameNameAsTarget`. Remaining consumers: reveal-until-find (Spoils of the Vault), hand-discard-by-name (Cabal Therapy). |
| Token-copy of permanent | 🟡 | Populate ✅ (`Effect::Populate`, CR 701.32 — Growing Ranks). `CreateTokenCopyOf` ✅, with a `non_legendary` rider (CR 707.2e — strips the copy's supertypes; Helm of the Host ✅). Mockingbird/Phantasmal Image clone-enter ✅ via `BecomeCopyOf`. Remaining: a true *continuous* "becomes a copy" layer-1 loop (Mirrorform aura). |
| Multi-pick decisions over revealed library cards | 🟡 | Atraxa Draw-4 stand-in is wired. Reveal-and-sort by card type, Dig Through Time, Mind's Desire all need a richer multi-pick decision. |
| Investigate + Clue token | 🟡 | Clue tokens ship (`clue_token()`; Tireless Tracker, Lonis create them). **Map tokens** now ship too (`map_token()` — CR 111.10s explore-token: {1},{T},Sac → target creature you control explores; Loot, the Pathfinder mints one). The Investigate keyword-action naming and "sacrifice a Clue" payoff abilities are still ⏳. |
| Landfall trigger | 🟡 | Bloodghast wired via the new `EventScope::FromYourGraveyard` (graveyard-source `LandPlayed` trigger). Standard battlefield-side landfall (Omnath) still uses the existing `LandPlayed` + `YourControl` path; both are functional. |
| Loyalty abilities w/ static | 🟡 | Teferi works fully; loyalty-set effects ship via `Effect::SetLoyalty` (CR 606 — Geyadrone Dihada's +1 reset-when-behind ✅). Needs further variants (Ashiok exile-and-cast, Karn -2 fetch, Saheeli token-copy, Sorin drain, Tezzeret etheric, Tamiyo). |
| Split / DFC modal cards (`Wear // Tear`) | ⏳ | Wear // Tear, Sundering Eruption (sorcery side), most "// Land" DFCs in the cube. |
| Living-weapon-on-ETB token | ⏳ | Nettlecyst, Sword-of-Body-and-Mind-adjacent. |
| Protection-from-color (more colors) | 🟡 | Engine has `Keyword::Protection(Color)`. Cards like Stillmoon Cavalier need toggle abilities + multi-color protection. |
| Charge counters as mana storage | 🟡 | Gemstone Mine wires charge counters + sac-on-empty. Coalition Relic now does the faithful precombat-main "remove all charges → 1 mana of any color each" burst (`MayDo` + `AddMana(AnyColors(CountersOn))` + `RemoveCounter(CountersOn)`). Power Depot, Pentad Prism, Chalice of the Void reuse the same charge primitive. |

## Plan

The cube is far too large to wire card-by-card on its own. The most
leverage comes from finishing the engine features above, then sweeping
groups of cards in batches. Suggested order:

1. **Token primitives** (Treasure / Blood / Clue / Food). Unlocks ~25
   cube cards in one batch.
2. **Equipment + Vehicles** (equip cost / crew). Unlocks Lion Sash,
   Shuko, Sword of …, Helm, Nettlecyst, Lavaspur Boots, Smuggler's
   Copter, Esika's Chariot.
3. **Cascade / Storm / Madness / Delve / Cycling** are each fairly small
   targeted features that unlock 3–5 cards apiece.
4. **DFC / Split-card / Adventure** infrastructure unlocks a wide swath
   of modern lands plus Wear // Tear, Sundering Eruption, etc.
5. **Multi-pick decisions** (reveal-and-sort, Dig Through Time, Atraxa
   real ETB, Mind's Desire) — promotes Atraxa to ✅ and unlocks several
   blue payoff spells.
6. **Counters / charge-mana / proliferate** for Mossborn Hydra, Heliod,
   Coalition Relic, Power Depot, Cankerbloom, etc.

Promote individual cards from ⏳ to 🟡 → ✅ as their dependent feature
lands. The status table above is the source of truth; update it
alongside the engine row when an effect ships.
