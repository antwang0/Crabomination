# Strixhaven implementation tracker

Two adjacent catalogs: **Secrets of Strixhaven (SOS)** (`catalog::sets::sos`)
and **Strixhaven: School of Mages (STX)** (`catalog::sets::stx`).

All ✅-done cards have been elided — the tables below list only the
remaining **🟡 partial** and **⏳ todo** work. For full per-card history see
`git log -- crabomination/src/catalog/sets/{stx,sos}/`.

## Legend

- 🟡 partial — body wired with simplified or stub effect; key behavior missing
- ⏳ todo — not yet implemented

## Known engine gaps surfaced by these catalogs

- **Lessons sideboard / Learn** — Eyetwitch, Pest Summoning, Hunt for
  Specimens, Field Trip, Igneous Inspiration. Approximated as `Draw 1`.
- **Cast-from-graveyard / cast-from-exile pipelines** — block several
  Paradigm cards and the lone SOS ⏳ (Improvisation Capstone).
- **Multi-target prompts on instants/sorceries** — recurring 🟡 reason
  across SOS/STX (Vibrant Outburst, Snow Day, Devious Cover-Up, Crackle
  with Power, Magma Opus). Divided-damage / per-mode multi-target slots
  remain a gap distinct from the bag-of-targets primitives.

## Red

| Card | Mana Cost | Type | P/T | Oracle Text | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Impractical Joke | {R} | Sorcery |  | Damage can't be prevented this turn. Impractical Joke deals 3 damage to up to one target creature or planeswalker. | 🟡 | 3-to-creature/PW wired; "damage can't be prevented" rider is a no-op (engine has no damage-prevention layer). |
| Steal the Show | {2}{R} | Sorcery |  | Choose one or both — / • Target player discards any number of cards, then draws that many cards. / • Steal the Show deals damage equal to the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard to target creature or planeswalker. | 🟡 | Per-mode behavior is faithful (mode 0 = `DiscardAnyNumber` then draw-that-many via `Value::CardsDiscardedThisEffect`; mode 1 = damage = IS-cards in your gy). Only the "choose one **or both**" rider collapses to a single mode pick (no multi-mode-pick that fills two target slots). |
| Tablet of Discovery | {2}{R} | Artifact |  | When this artifact enters, mill a card. You may play that card this turn. (To mill a card, put the top card of your library into your graveyard.) / {T}: Add {R}. / {T}: Add {R}{R}. Spend this mana only to cast instant and sorcery spells. | 🟡 | Wired in `catalog::sets::sos::artifacts` — ETB Mill 1 + two `{T}: Add {R}` mana abilities. The "may play that card this turn" mill-rider is omitted (no per-card may-play primitive yet). The spend-restriction on the {T}: Add {R}{R} ability is omitted (no spend-restricted mana primitive). |

## Prismari (Blue-Red)

| Card | Mana Cost | Type | P/T | Oracle Text | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Abstract Paintmage | {U}{U/R}{R} | Creature — Djinn Sorcerer | 2/2 | At the beginning of your first main phase, add {U}{R}. Spend this mana only to cast instant and sorcery spells. | 🟡 | Wired in `catalog::sets::sos::creatures` with a `StepBegins(PreCombatMain)/ActivePlayer` trigger that adds {U}{R} via `ManaPayload::Colors`. The spend restriction is omitted (no per-pip mana metadata). The hybrid `{U/R}` pip is approximated as `{U}`. |
| Prismari, the Inspiration | {5}{U}{R} | Legendary Creature — Elder Dragon | 7/7 | Flying / Ward—Pay 5 life. / Instant and sorcery spells you cast have storm. | 🟡 | Flying + Ward(5) approximated as generic mana. Storm grant omitted. |

## Silverquill (White-Black)

| Card | Mana Cost | Type | P/T | Oracle Text | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conciliator's Duelist | {W}{W}{B}{B} | Creature — Kor Warlock | 4/3 | When this creature enters, draw a card. Each player loses 1 life. / Repartee — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets a creature, exile up to one target creature. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step. | 🟡 | ETB body wired (draw 1 + each player loses 1). Repartee exile half wired via the new `Selector::CastSpellTarget(0)` primitive. The "return at next end step" rider is still omitted (no capture-as-target-from-selector primitive yet). |
| Fix What's Broken | {2}{W}{B} | Sorcery |  | As an additional cost to cast this spell, pay X life. / Return each artifact and creature card with mana value X from your graveyard to the battlefield. | 🟡 | Wired in `catalog::sets::sos::sorceries` (push XVII): Lose 2 life + return artifact/creature cards with MV ≤ 2 from gy → bf. X collapsed to 2 (no X-life-as-cost primitive). |

## Lorehold (Red-White)

| Card | Mana Cost | Type | P/T | Oracle Text | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lorehold, the Historian | {3}{R}{W} | Legendary Creature — Elder Dragon | 5/5 | Flying, haste / Each instant and sorcery card in your hand has miracle {2}. (You may cast a card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn.) / At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card. | 🟡 | Body-only wire (5/5 Flying+Haste Legendary Elder Dragon, R/W). Miracle grant on instants/sorceries in hand is omitted (no miracle/alt-cost-on-draw primitive); per-opp-upkeep loot trigger omitted (no opp-upkeep step trigger that fires for non-active player). The vanilla finisher is the most impactful printed clause — both omitted clauses are tracked in TODO.md. |
| Molten Note | {X}{R}{W} | Sorcery |  | Molten Note deals damage to target creature equal to the amount of mana spent to cast this spell. Untap all creatures you control. / Flashback {6}{R}{W} | 🟡 | X+2 damage to creature + untap all your creatures + Flashback. Only edge left: a flashback cast reads X=0, so its damage is undercounted (the "mana spent" model only tracks the {X} pip). |

### Engine pieces driven by STX

- ⏳ **Lesson sideboard model** — Eyetwitch, Hunt for Specimens, Pest
  Summoning all use Learn at some point. Currently approximated as
  `Draw 1`.
