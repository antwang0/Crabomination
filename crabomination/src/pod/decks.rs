//! The Commander pod's target decks.
//!
//! Eight hand-picked commanders, each with a 99 drawn from cards this engine
//! already implements: legal under CR 903 (100 cards including the commander,
//! singleton outside basics, every card inside the commander's CR 903.4 color
//! identity) and Commander-legal per Scryfall's ban list, both of which
//! `pod::tests` asserts rather than trusts.
//!
//! They are not official preconstructed lists: a precon's partition into four
//! decks is not derivable from the offline Scryfall cache this repo carries,
//! and a list nobody can verify is worse than one the suite checks every run.
//! What they keep from the precon idea is what the pod needs — fixed, legal,
//! eight different color identities, and built to play against each other.
//! One is a Partner pair (CR 702.124b), one is a **planeswalker**
//! (CR 903.3a) and one is a **Choose a Background** pair (CR 702.124k); all
//! three sit past the fourth slot, because `pod_field(n)` takes the first `n`
//! and appending is what keeps the committed outcome table from moving.
//!
//! Each list is ~37 lands (12 nonbasic), the format's colorless staples, then
//! ramp / removal / draw / a creature curve, so bots finish games with them.
